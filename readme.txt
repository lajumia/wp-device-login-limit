A plugin to limit users to a fixed number of devices and verify new devices via OTP.

== Description ==
Limit users to logging in from a fixed number of devices. Devices are whitelisted. New devices require email OTP verification, and admins can reset devices per user.


== Features ==
* Hard device whitelist (not session based)
* Global device limit for all users
* OTP verification for new devices
* OTP expiry configurable (default 10 minutes)
* Admin reset device access per user
* Frontend shortcode to display user devices: [wpdll_my_devices]
* Automatic redirect for verified devices
* WooCommerce login compatible

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings → Device Login Limit** to set the maximum number of devices per user.

== Email Delivery (Important) ==
This plugin relies on email delivery for OTP verification.
We strongly recommend installing one of the following SMTP plugins:

- WP Mail SMTP

Without SMTP, OTP emails may fail on many hosting environments. We strongly recommend configuring SMTP before using the plugin.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What happens if a user exceeds the device limit? =
Users will be required to verify new devices via OTP. If the limit is reached, login will be blocked until an existing device is freed by admin.

Yes, admins can reset devices per user from their profile page. Users will need to verify devices again on their next login.
